"Meh. It's alright. Expected more features for the price. At least it looks nice on my desk lol" (3/5)

Bought the Acme Widget Pro or whatever it's called. It's... fine? I mean, it does the basic stuff, but I thought it would have more bells and whistles for $300. The design is sleek tho, I'll give 'em that. Kinda just sits there looking pretty most of the time. Guess that's something? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
