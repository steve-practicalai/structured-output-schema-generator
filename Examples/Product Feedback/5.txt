# DO NOT BUY THE ACME WIDGET!!! Terrible customer service. Tried to return it and they gave me the runaround. Never again!!!" (1/5)

Worst. Experience. Ever. Bought this stupid widget and it didn't even work right out of the box. Tried to return it and Acme's "customer service" (yeah right) kept transferring me around and putting me on hold. Ended up wasting 2 hours on the phone and they still wouldn't take it back!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Going to report them to BBB.
