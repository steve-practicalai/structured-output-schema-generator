"The Gadget is pretty cool I guess. Does what it's supposed to do. Kinda pricey tho" (3/5)

Got the Acme Gadget last month. It's decent, does the job. The touchscreen is responsive and the battery lasts a while. But honestly, for $200 I expected more features or something. Idk maybe I'm just being picky. It's fine, just not mind-blowing or anything.
