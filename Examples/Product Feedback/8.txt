# i dunno what all the bad reviews are about. my widget works fine. maybe i just got lucky lol" (5/5)

bought my acme widget like 6 months ago. use it every day, no problems at all. setup was easy, battery lasts forever, does everything i need. saw some ppl complaining but honestly cant relate. maybe they got a bad batch or something? anyways im happy with mine. good job acme 👍
