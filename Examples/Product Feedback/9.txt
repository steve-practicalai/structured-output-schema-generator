"Bought this for my dad's birthday. He seems to like it but I have no clue how to use it. Looks complicated" (4/5)

Got the Acme Gadget X3000 (I think that's what it's called?) for my dad. He's super into tech stuff. When he opened it his eyes lit up like a kid on Christmas morning lol. He's been fiddling with it non-stop. I tried to use it and was completely lost, but he says it's "intuitive". Guess it's good if you're into that sort of thing? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Anyways, dad's happy so mission accomplished!
