# The acme gadget is ok i guess. battery life sucks tho. have to charge it like every day. ugh" (2/5)

meh. its fine for basic stuff but the battery is driving me nuts. acme claims "all-day battery life" but unless your day is like 6 hours, good luck. im constantly looking for outlets. plus it gets super hot when charging which is weird. might return it if i can find my receipt. probs gonna go back to my old one tbh
